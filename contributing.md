Ensure your pull request is 100% ready when you open it and should adhere to all the following guidelines:

- The intent of this list is to gather awesome resources _that most people would need_.
- The bar of getting something accepted is high, so only submit something unique and generally useful.
- Pull requests with copyright violations, paywalled or restricted content, promotional or engagement-driven social posts, vendor marketing and product pitches will not be accepted.
- Search the repository and existing pull requests before making a new one, as yours could be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each of your suggestions.
- Use the following format: `[Resource title](resource link) - Some resource description.`
- New resource additions should be added at the correct position in the appropriate category, preserving alphabetical ordering.
- Keep descriptions concise and simple, but descriptive.
- Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
- Descriptions should not be title-case.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove trailing whitespaces.
- The pull request should have a useful title and a description with a note about why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your contribution!

### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
